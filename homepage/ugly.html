                                        <p>We write an android app by android studio, the app includes many functions like scan the QRcode and barcode.
                                            It can also locate the participants and owners of the experiments. 
                                            Owners can publish or close his or her experiments, and get the result report from the app.

                                        <p class="d">May 2021 – July 2021</p>
                                        <p>As we all know, when a car leaves factory it will be assigned a CCC code, and it was typed manually.
                                            This costs a lot of time, so we use image recognition technology to help workers put in the numbers more quickly.
                                            We provide workers a machine to scan the number of the CCC code,
                                            then computer will recognize the number automatically and type it into the system.
                                            We use the mobilenet2 + svm algorithm in this project.

                                            We use the django rest framework for the backend and react for the frontend.
                                            I did the frontend and part of backend of the assessment part.
                                            Now I am trying to add timer when the user taking the assessment.

                                When I was 15, a boy sent me cookies which baked by himself for a semester.
                                Then I transferred to another school.
                                But I still remember the taste of the cookies and his love.
                                I think that's why I love baking.
                                Both receiver and sender will feel warm and happiness.

                            <p>My aunt is schizophrenia, 
                                she suspended her drug without permission when I was 11, 
                                and I saw how she became crazy and was sent to the mental hospital.
                                So I wished I would study psychology to cure her.
                                However, my parents opposed me to study psychology.
                                Then I found I was also interested in computer science and that's why I am here now.

                            <p>My home is nearby a library, <br>
                                I spent time in the library in summer holiday during my childhood. <br>
                                My favorite books are Hongloumeng, One hundred years of solitude and Heike monogatari.<br>
                                However, the stories are so heavy that they make me would like to convert to Buddhism when I read them.<br>
                                And that's why my name on the github is "solitariaa".
